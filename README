Simple python + qt5 powermenu. Made for myself for using in QTILE....

Put wm_power_menu in some DIR which is in yours executable path...

Maybe you need to make it executable:

chmod +x wm_power_menu

Call wm_power_menu any way you want... :)

P.S. You need to have installed python-pyqt5 (arch package name).
