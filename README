Simple python + qt5 powermenu. Made for myself for using in QTILE....

Put wm_power_menu in some DIR and make bash script for starting, somethin like this:

#!/bin/bash
python /path_to_the_dir/wm_power_menu.py

Now you can put that script in /usr/local/bin or any #PATH of your system...


P.S. You need to have installed python-pyqt5 (arch package name).
